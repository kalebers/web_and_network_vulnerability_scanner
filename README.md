# Web and Network vulnerability scans

- As a way to understand more about web and network security, I developed two scripts, one for network vulnerability scan and another to search for websites vulnerabilities by a given URL.

- This project IS STRICTED TO RESEARCH AND BUG BOUNTY. USE CAREFULLY.

- Requirements:
    - You will need to install beatiful soap for python using ```pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-nmap lxml```, nmap (if you are using macOS ```brew install nmap```, linux ```sudo apt-get install nmap``` or windows in [link](https://nmap.org/download.html)) and scapy ```pip install python-nmap scapy```. 
    - Use Python 3.10 or later.
